## Wipeout

**The problem**
The project birthed from unfortunate events, when one of our housemates were left stranded in the washroom with that dreaded brown cardboard role on the toilet paper bar. They shouted and shouted, but their screams were not heard. This dire situation was inevitable due to the combination of noise cancelling headphones, and lazy housemates in the first place. 

**Our solution**
We have implemented a button that sends an SMS message to all of your housemates to alert them of your emergency situation. We connected to a RaspberryPi that when pressed runs a python script to call our REST API that will then send out the text messages. The REST API was built and hosted on StdLib's platform.

**Added usability**
We developed a web dashboard using React to add and remove SMS receivers and display our product.

**Build for Hackwestern 5**
